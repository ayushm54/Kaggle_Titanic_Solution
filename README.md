# Kaggle_Titanic_Solution
In this challenge, we have to build a predictive model to predict whether a passanger will survive the sinking on the Titanic ship. We are given the dataset with attributes like pclass, sex, Age, sibsp,etc. and we need to predict the survived value.

Basically this is a Binary Classification problem and we are going to build a Logistic Regression Model. 

## Steps :
1. Data Loading
2. Data Inspection
3. Data Cleaning
4. Exploratory Data Analysis
5. Data Transformation
6. Train Test Split
7. Model Building
8. Model Evaluation
9. Predicition on Test Set
